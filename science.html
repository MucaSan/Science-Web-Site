      <h1>Scientists' career</h1>
      <br>
      <p> Scientists have become more visible to the public eye due to ongoing crises such as COVID-19 and climate change. Despite their expertise, the field is overlooked by the public and often ignored. Scientists dedicate their entire lives to their chosen field of study, enduring many years of difficult coursework, extensive research, and training. </p>
  <p>
        Despite the amount of intense work that goes into becoming a career scientist, the public is quick to dismiss their work and to instead idolize actors, models, professional athletes and other celebrities that are more apparent to the public eye.
  </p>
  <h1>Science Usage</h1>
   <p>    
        Science is the greatest collective endeavor. It contributes to ensuring a longer and healthier life, monitors our health, provides medicine to cure our diseases, alleviates aches and pains, helps us to provide water for our basic needs – including our food, provides energy and makes life more fun, including sports, music, entertainment and the latest communication technology.
   </p>
       <p>  
        Science generates solutions for everyday life and helps us to answer the great mysteries of the universe. In other words, science is one of the most important channels of knowledge.
   </p>

   <h1>Science Importance</h1>
   <p>  
        Science must respond to societal needs and global challenges. Public understanding and engagement with science, and citizen participation including through the popularization of science are essential to equip citizens to make informed personal and professional choices.</p>

        <p> Science is somewhat present in all of our daily basis. It’s hard to say why some people neglect it. Its present is only meant for the best for mankind, for instance, everything we hold or see was primarily constructed by the technology and science. Engineering, literacy, mathematics, philosophy, chemistry, languages and codes, everything, comes from the same root: science. </p>
<p>
          Therefore, it’s safe to say that science is VERY important for the existance of what we have nowadays in our lifes. We should be grateful for the whole development that our species are witnessing. 
</p>

<h1>Science's Vision</h1>
<p> 


          Science is mankind and mankind is science, within our minds there’s a limit of memory, a limit of information that can be stored, so, if we don’t persue what we really want, that’s the knowledge, who will? It’s necessary to go beyond our boundaries, and finally, seek the knowledge. No matter what’s your objective, science and knowledge itself will help you. Do not give up, only other species do that. 
</p>
    <p>      
          We’re humans, capable of changing the envorinment for good or for bad. We’re gods, but, all of that comes with a price. That might be our own self-destruction.</p>
