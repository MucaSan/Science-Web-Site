      <h1 class="Revolution">Technology Revolution</h1>
      <br>
     
      <p>A technological revolution is a period in which one or more technologies is replaced by another, novel technology in a short amount of time.</p>

      <p>
        It is an era of accelerated technological progress characterized by new innovations whose rapid application and diffusion typically cause an abrupt change in society.</p>
        <h1 class="subtitles"class="Society">Technology on our lifes!</h1>
        <div class="sticker">  &lt;3 Technology!</div>

        <br>
        <p class="Society"> <span class="contrast">The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. </span> And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.</p>

      <br>

      <p class="Society">
        There is <span class="contrast"> no denying </span> that the future of technology will continue to revolutionize our lives. In a few years, driverless cars may be the norm for everyone, and robots will be commonplace in factories. Future technology <span class="contrast"> is sure </span> to transform our lives in unbelievable ways, but here we  highlight the many common ways technology is changing our lives today.</p>
        
        <h1 class="subtitles" class="End">Surrouding Technology</h1>

        <br>
        <p class="End"> <span class="contrast">Technology is the field of  information </span>, every single unit of data, called ‘bits’ is used to measure a number of information in a person, program, file or anything you could think of. Instead, think of it as roots, which come from a common center, that spreads across all the multiple possibilities, making something incredible to the user’s eyes, a unique project.</p>
  
      <br>
    
      <p class="End">
        Within Technology there’s <span class="contrast">a lot to be discovered </span>, you’ll never be able to know everything about this field, not even know 10% of what’s the so called ‘IT’ area, there’s so much to be studied, developed further and written that the whole idea of knowing everything sounds arrogant. We should be proud of being apart of a beautiful area, I hope that this small topic has whatsoever helped you with your thoughts about technology.</p>

        <p class="End"> Before you change to the next area, here’s some informations about technology area: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It’s expected to grow between 2020 and 2030. </li>
          <li>Has high paying salaries </li>
          <li>Brings all people together in miliseconds.</li>
          <li>Is capable to developing the humankind perspective about the world. </li>
           <li>Allows you to solve problems every single day, while enjoying it. </li>
        </ul>          
               
          <p>
              After all, we aren’t on this area only for the money, also for the challenge! <span class="smile"> >:) <span></p>
